A physics-informed data-driven model applied for gas dispersion. This code trains a Physics-Informed Data-Driven model to reproduce steady-state dispersion simulations of methane in the air using Deep Learning. 

Dispersion: code for training the dispersion model. Separated in 2D and 3D dispersion simulations. 
Cavity: code for training the lid-driven cavity model.

Libraries: deepxde, tensorflow, matplotlib.
